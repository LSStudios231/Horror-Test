# Get Into It! — Mobile Game

**Horror Test** is a 2D psychological test-style mobile game where the player answers a series of questions designed to build tension and unease.

## Gameplay Overview
The player is presented with 20 questions and is encouraged to answer honestly. The game manipulates pacing, wording, and audiovisual cues to create suspense. The final twist suggests an incoming jumpscare — but intentionally subverts the player’s expectation by not actually showing one.
